Here we go. This is the first post where I want to explain purpose of this site as well as give some ideas what you may find here.

I'm computer-sciense enthusiast who's excited about how computer techonologies have changed our lives. Surei, those changes ain't always good though, but still they're pretty exciting and no doubts that something even more interesting may happen in the near fututre and technical specialists like me and probably you may become a part of it. So far I believe we're going to reach a brand new level or maybe even the era of computer-human interaction. Before we saw just very passive computer systems which were driven by man through different types (mostly GUI though) of interfaces, which were just really interfaces for accessing and manipulating data stored in different places. But now we got critical mass of AI related researches which make possible to go to the next level of the computer evolution and make computer not only a complex console we enter/gather information to/from but a full complex system which may assist human in his everyday routines and operations.

Today we see first attempts to create so-called AI-powered bots which may understand natural languages and do some required by user operations. So far it's very often chat-bots which exist rather for fan, sometimes to help you order pizza, show a weather, etc. But as more complex these AI-powered bots become the more sophisticated tasks they will be able to solve. At the end of the day we'll get systems one of which has been described by Arthur Clarke in his famous A Space Oddysey - HAL 9000. A system which may control entire spacecraft and all its systems. And it's not just a fantasy - it's our goal to make such system which may efficiently manage low level sub-system while human makes some strategic high-level descisions.

However the example above is just one domain where such AI technology may be used. There're plenty areas and specific tasks we may build HAL-like system for. Although different domains require different approaches, we'll face on our way similar patterns of solving common problems for building such systems, applying them to real processes. So here we go, this site is our journey toward this and aims to research development of AI-powered bots to find these patterns and solve them by creating a framework which allows us to easily create a complex AI system as we create WEB applications now with using Ruby on Rails, Django, Spring etc.

Wish good luck to us on this way!
